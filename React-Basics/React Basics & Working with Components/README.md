# React Basics & Working with Components

## What you should know:
	- react is declarative -you define the 'goal' and let React figure out how to get there
	- jsx - non-standard syntax which is enabled in React, because it gets complicated in Javascript
	- React Shadow DOM ( with React elements) and DOM which is updated only when a state or props change and only there
	- props - pass data through components ( properties )
	- display dynamic data
	- composition vs inheritance
